### Welcome!

New medical devices and therapies stand to improve human health outcomes the world over.
Though innovating in this space is challenging, predictive simulations provide a promising path forward.
I am a **computational scientist** who clears these paths via new data-driven models, algorithms, and extreme-scale software.
Recent examples include the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/bryngelson-IJMF-20.pdf" target="_blank">most efficient sub-grid model</a> for simulating cavitation, a <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/bryngelson-PRE-19.pdf" target="_blank">low-order model</a> for cell-scale blood flow, and <a href="https://mfc-caltech.github.io/" target="_blank">MFC</a>, my open-source multi-phase flow solver.
These developments guide biomicrofluidic device design and improve treatment outcomes (e.g. burst-wave <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/lithotripsy" target="_blank">lithotripsy</a>).

### About me

I am a Senior Postdoctoral Scholar at the California Institute of Technology, working with <a href="https://www.colonius.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Tim Colonius</a>.
I also work with <a href="http://sandlab.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Themis Sapsis</a> at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on machine-learned model closures.
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://xpacc.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Exascale Simulation of Plasma-Coupled Combustion</a> (XPACC).
I have a Ph.D. and M.S. in <a href="https://mechanical.illinois.edu/graduate/graduate-degree-programs/phd-programs/phd-theoretical-and-applied-mechanics" target="_blank">Theoretical and Applied Mechanics</a> from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign (2017 and 2015), where I worked with <a href="https://aerospace.illinois.edu/directory/profile/jbfreund" target="_blank">Professor Jonathan Freund</a>.
I hold B.S. degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Michigan–Dearborn (2013).
