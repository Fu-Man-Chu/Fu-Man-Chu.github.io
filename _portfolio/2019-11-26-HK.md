title: 'Selective Blindness with Hong Kongese Characteristics'
date: 2019-11-26
excerpt: "The Beaver, LSE, issue #907. See the original publication [here](https://issuu.com/readbeaveronline/docs/full_80e3cee5900f8c). The piece berates Western press for biased coverage of the 2019 Hong Kong protests, where nativist populism loomed over democratic aspirations."
