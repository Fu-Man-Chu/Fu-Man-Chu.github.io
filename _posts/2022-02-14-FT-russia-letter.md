Financial Times, Letters to Editor. See the original publication [here](https://www.ft.com/content/02514919-6948-493c-9d89-9072a96c6737). The letter is a brief expository response to the FT's early coverage of China's position in the Russian invasion of Ukraine, amid the initial confusions.

That the Chinese foreign ministry’s deliberate ambivalence on the Ukraine crisis is completely lost on the wider world speaks volumes about China’s lack of soft power (“Don’t mention the invasion: China spins Russia’s war in Ukraine”, [Report](https://www.ft.com/content/8d2e9f59-06b2-4e90-aba9-fd32249f67be), FT.com, February 26). Overlooked is China’s bilateral relations with Ukraine. China is Ukraine’s largest trading partner, importing over $2bn worth of agricultural products in 2019. China has also made sizeable investments in Ukraine, ranging from telecom infrastructure to numerous government contracts.

For all the talk in the west of a Sino-Russian alliance, Russia has guarded its military technology jealously in arms sales to China. It is to Ukraine that China often turned to acquire military technology.

Ukraine is a country where China has invested heavily in order to gain influence in the region. A war there hardly helps.
